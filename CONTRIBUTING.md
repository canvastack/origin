## Development Setup

cd origin
composer install
```

Requirements:

- Laravel 8.x / 9.x / 10.x

## Running Tests

## Coding Standards

- PHP 8.0+ type hints required on all methods (parameters and return types)
- Use `FormConstants` class — no magic strings
- All user-facing output must be escaped via `canvastack_form_escape_html()`
- PHPDoc required for all public methods (`@param`, `@return`, `@throws`)
- Follow PSR-12 coding style
- Keep methods under 50 lines — extract helpers if needed
- Use descriptive variable names (no `$o`, `$s`, `$x`)
