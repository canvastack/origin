## Security Fixes

> ⚠️ Users on v1.0.x are strongly advised to upgrade immediately. Critical vulnerabilities have been patched in this release.

- **XSS Protection** — Automatic HTML escaping added to all 22 form methods across Objects.php and all element traits
- **File Upload Security** — Multi-layer validation: extension whitelist, MIME type content verification, size limits, random filename generation, path traversal protection, and file permission enforcement (0644)
- **SQL Injection Prevention** — Encrypted AJAX payloads with HMAC integrity checking for `sync()` method
- **Attribute Injection** — Dangerous attributes (`onclick`, `onerror`, `onload`, etc.) are now blocked
- **Path Traversal** — All file paths validated using `realpath()` before processing
- **Model Tampering** — Model names encrypted with HMAC to prevent client-side tampering

## Accessibility Improvements (WCAG 2.1 Level A)

- Full ARIA attribute support across all form elements:
  - `aria-checked` for checkboxes and radio buttons
  - `aria-required`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby` for inputs
  - `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby` for tabs
  - `aria-disabled` for disabled elements
  - `aria-live` for alert messages
- Proper `<label for>` associations on all inputs
- Keyboard navigation support with logical tab order
- Screen reader tested with NVDA and JAWS

## New Features

- **Validation Propagation** — Server-side Laravel validation rules automatically propagate to client-side HTML attributes (`required`, `min`, `max`, `maxlength`, `accept`, `type`)
- **SafeHtml Marker System** — Prevents double-encoding while maintaining XSS protection
- **AriaHelper Class** — Centralized ARIA attribute generation utility
- **FormConstants Class** — Eliminates all magic strings across form components
- **PHP 8.0+ Type Hints** — 100% type hint coverage on all methods

## Code Quality

- All methods now have complete PHPDoc (`@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, `@security`)
- Methods exceeding 50 lines extracted into focused helpers
- Descriptive exceptions with context data (no silent failures)
- Security event logging for audit trails
